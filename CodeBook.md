==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

Each row/record contains a subset of the actual data set with only the average of mean() and StdDev measurements by Volunteers and by the six activities

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals TimeAcceleration-XYZ and TimeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'Time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into "body" and "gravity" acceleration signals for mean() and std() variables (TimeBodyAcclerationMean-XYZ and TimeGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals for mean() and std() variables (TimeBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ and TimeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals for mean() and std() variables were calculated using the Euclidean norm (TimeBodyAccelerationMagnitude, TimeGravityAccelerationMagnitude, TimeBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, TimeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, TimeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals similar to the Time domain signals producing FFTBodyAcceleration-XYZ, FFTBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, FFTBodyGyroscope-XYZ, FFTBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, FFTBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, FFTBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude for frequency domain signals. Again this data set is only for mean(0 and std() measurements from the original data set.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Average Measurements are as follows:

Information about the data (cleanup and transformation):
--------------------------------------------------------
1)Each row/record contains a subset of the actual data set with only the average of mean() and StdDev measurements by Volunteers and by the six activities
2) Activity data was cleaned up to have descriptive activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) as opposed to activity codes
3) Variables names were replaced by descriptive variable names (listed above in the "Description of variables" section)
4) Final data was grouped by Subject and Activity by averaging the measurements (listed above in the "Description of variables" section)
